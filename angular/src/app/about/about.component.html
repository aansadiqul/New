                    This project is the modern version of my.neilsonmarketing.com. We have developed this site using
                    Asp.net Boilerplate application framework.
                </p>

                <h3>What is ASP.NET Boilerplate?</h3>

                <p>
                    ASP.NET Boilerplate is an application framework built on latest <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>
                    framework.
                    It makes easy to use authorization, dependency injection, validation, exception handling,
                    localization, logging, caching, background jobs and so on.
                    It's built on already familiar tools like Entity Framework, AutoMapper, Castle Windsor...
                </p>

                <p>
                    ASP.NET Boilerplate implements <strong>NLayer architecture</strong> (Domain, Application,
                    Infrastructure and Presentation Layers)
                    and <strong>Domain Driven Design</strong> (Entities, Repositories, Domain/Application Services,
                    DTO's...).
                    Also implements and provides a good infrastructure to implement common software development
                    <strong>best practices</strong>.
                </p>


                <h4>Based on Microsoft ASP.NET Core Identity</h4>

                <p>
                    This framework is based on Microsoft's
                    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity"
                        target="_blank">ASP.NET Core Identity</a> library.
                    It extends user and role managers and implements user and role stores using generic repositories.
